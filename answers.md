### Q1 – Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery

I would use AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot to autocomplete React Native components, suggest hooks, or generate boilerplate quickly. For example, while building a form, Copilot can auto-suggest state setup, validation logic, and common patterns. Design tools like Figma with AI can generate screen layouts based on text input, helping to iterate quickly. These tools save time while still allowing developers to review and control code quality.

### Q2 – Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students

Two features:
1. "Physics Bot": An AI assistant that explains any Physics formula or term in simple language, with animated illustrations and voice support.
2. "Concept Checker": Students can input their answers, and the AI will identify misconceptions, offering hints.

User Journey:
- A student opens the app, types "What is Bernoulli’s principle?"
- AI shows a definition with animation of fluid dynamics.
- Student uploads a photo of handwritten notes; AI highlights incorrect steps.
- Voice assistant offers follow-up tips.
